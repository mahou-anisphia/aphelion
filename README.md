# Aphelion 🌟

> _The furthest point in orbit—where abandoned projects drift, waiting to return._

A Kanban-style project management board designed specifically for tracking abandoned, paused, and sidelined projects. Built with Angular and TypeScript.

## 🌌 Philosophy

> _Aphelion (noun): The point in the orbit of a planet, asteroid, or comet at which it is furthest from the sun._

Every developer has a graveyard of projects—ideas that burned bright before fading into the void. Aphelion doesn't judge. It tracks them, organizes them, and helps you decide: revive, archive, or let go.

This board doesn't demand you finish everything. It accepts the reality of abandoned projects and gives them a place to exist—far from the sun, but not lost in space.

**Built with ☕ and acceptance of unfinished work.**

_"Not all who wander are lost, but some projects definitely are."_
